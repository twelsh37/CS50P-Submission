        This is my final project submission for Harvard Universitys CS50P.
        The application utilises an open-source application framework for building the web application.
        The application is frontended by a login page where only authorised users can gain access to the main application.
        The login page is back-ended to the [Deta Base NoSQL database](https://www.deta.sh/), which is used to store our user credentials.
        When the user gains access to the main application Area they are presented with an opening page displaying a stock ticker for user selectable instraments, Some metric boxes for the associated ticker symbols.
        There are then other selectable options available in the side bar that will allow the user to display different information.''')

        * Dash/Plotly - https://plotly.com/dash/ - A modern day gui tool used to build web based applications and dashboards. Integrates well with plotly.I have used it before so discounted as i wanted to learn a new library
        * Streamlit - https://streamlit.io - Open source application Framework for developing web apps.
